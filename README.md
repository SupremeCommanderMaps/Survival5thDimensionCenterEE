# Survival 5th Dimension Center EE

A survival map for [Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance Forever][FAF] that supports 1 to 8 players. Best with 4 players.

Enemy units come from all 4 corners. Your job is to protect the defence objective at the center of the map.
You lose instantly if it gets destroyed. If you survive the increasingly difficult waves till minute 40 you win.

When playing with fewer than 4 players, the unoccupied lanes will not receive any units and the total amount
of incoming units is reduced proportionally.

The map supports many options that can be changed in the lobby by the game host.
